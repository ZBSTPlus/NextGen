title: Find the numbers of Fibonacci Series
description: |
    In this game the Player must select all the polygonal numbers exist in the given grid in the
    given time limit.
rules: |
    Select the Polygonal numbers which are displayed.
    Polygonal number is a number represented as dots or pebbles arranged in the shape of a regular polygon.
    The dots are thought of as alphas (units). These are one type of 2-dimensional figurate numbers.
    Example: The number 10 for example, can be arranged as a triangle
    Try to finish the game within the time limit.
    You should not exceed more than 8 wrong answers

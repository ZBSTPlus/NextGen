title: Find the Factorial numbers
description: |
    In this game the Player must select all the factorial numbers exist in the given grid in the
    given time maxNumberInGrid.
rules: |
    Select the Factorial numbers which are displayed.
    Factorial Numbers are the numbers which are factorials of some other numbers.
    Try to finish the game within the time maxNumberInGrid.
    You should not exceed more than 8 wrong answers
